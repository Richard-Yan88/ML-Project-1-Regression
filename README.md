# ML-Project-1-Regression
This is my first project on multiple linear regression.
Multiple linear regression assumes:
    1. There must be a linear relationship between the outcome variable and the independent variable
    2. Multivariate Normality - Multiple regression assumes that the residuals are normally distributed
    3. No multicollinearity - multiple regression assumes that the independet variables are not highly correlated with each
    other. This assumption is tested using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values
    4. Homoscedasticity - the variance of error terms are similar across the values of the independent variables. A plot of 
    standardized residuals versus predicted values can show whether points are equally distributed across all values of the
    independent variables. Multiple lienar regression requires atleast two independent variabels, which can be nominal, ordinal, or interval
    /ratio level variables. A rule of thumb for the sample size is that regression analysis requires at least 20 cases per independet variable
    in the analysis.
